🏦 Credit Scoring Model
A Machine Learning model to predict the creditworthiness of applicants using features like income, debt, credit history, and more. This project was created as part of an internship assignment.

📌 Project Summary
This model classifies whether a loan applicant is likely to be creditworthy or not, based on key financial indicators.
It follows a complete ML workflow:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Feature Scaling

Model Training (Logistic Regression)

Evaluation Metrics

Model Serialization (using .pkl)

✅ Key Features
Clean & beginner-friendly ML implementation

Uses Logistic Regression for binary classification

Includes data preprocessing, scaling, model saving

Can be extended to Streamlit / Flask UI

🔮 Future Scope
Add Streamlit-based web app for user inputs

Test with more advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Deploy as API using Flask or FastAPI
